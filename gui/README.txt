Here goes the GUI that is used to capture data from arduino, through USB, to a PC or Mac computer.


System Requirements
* Arduino, set up with the correct scripts and with the sensors attached correctly (see the folder called "arduino" in this repository for assistance in setting this up).
* Python. We recommend the distribution from www.python.org.
* wxPython. This is required for the graphical interface. We recommend downloading from www.wxpython.org.
